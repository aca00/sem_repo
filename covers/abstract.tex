Despite the fact that station safety is a crucial component of the overall structure in railway networks, incidents at stations continue to happen. It's essential to learn from these mistakes and advance traditional practises by analysing incidents and enhancing safety systems using cutting-edge technology, such as machine learning (ML).
Engineering systems are just one area where machine learning has been used, and it interacts with us constantly.
So, when it comes to safety in the railway business, we must take into account the technology that is now accessible in general and ML in particular.
In order to predict the characteristics of accident victims, this research investigates the use of the decision tree (DT) method in safety categorization and accident analysis at railway stations.
