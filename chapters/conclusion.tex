Machine learning is a promising technique that can improve safety at railway stations. The decision tree method is applied here to generate insights from data and to make predictions. The model gives an acceptable performance with the given test data set, but it needs to be further evaluated with more data in future to ensure its suitability. The main advantage of the decision tree method is that it generates interpretable results which we can represent visually. It will contribute in decision-making, and the insights obtained through this method can be applied to the design of future train stations. Decision tree method can also determine the importance and relevance of various factors in accident data. This model can eventually be enhanced to make decisions in real time by combining it with other systems.
